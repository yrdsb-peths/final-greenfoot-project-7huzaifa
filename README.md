# Final Greenfoot Project
In this zombie apocalypse game, your goal is to **SURVIVE!** As you eliminate zombies, the game will get progressively harder.

TIP: If you are having difficulty keeping up, **pre-fire** to eliminate zombies before they have spawned.

An array was used in the **MyWorld** class.
